Decision tree regression is a powerful too for predicting continuous target variables. It uses a tree-like structure to partition the input space into smaller regions, where each region has a constant predicted value. This makes it particularly well-suited for handling non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. Decision Tree Algorithm: Simple Steps 1) Gather data: Prepare your dataset with input features and a target variable.
Consider a regression problem, yi =f(xi)+εi, where given a training set D of n observations, D = {(xi , yi )|i = 1, . . . , n},
where x denotes an input vector of dimension D and y denotes a scalar output variable, we wish to make predictions f(x∗) for new input vector x∗ (not present in the training set).
1)Start with the root node: This node contains all data points.
2)Find the best split: Divide the data into subsets based on a chosen criterion (e.g., information gain).
3) Create child nodes: Each child node contains a subset of data from the parent node.
4) Repeat: Continue splitting until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., minimum data points in a node).
5) Predict: Traverse the tree to reach a leaf node and output the average target value for that node.
6) Evaluate: Use a testing set to assess the model's performance e.g., mean squared error).
7) Fine-tune: Adjust hyperparameters or use ensemble methods to improve accuracy.
